## TON Open League

The Open League is a community proposal to incentivize users to engage with the best projects in the TON ecosystem. The goal is to attract **5 million **users within the next year by offering TON coin-backed community incentives.

The strategy is to focus on building TON-based Telegram mini-apps and activate users with existing systems.

The pilot season will be invite-only, followed by **two main seasons** with potential community-approved changes based on the results of the pilot. The TON Foundation is prepared to allocate up to 100 million TON for this program over the next five years.

The Open League has the following goals in different seasons:

1. 1 million Users: The goal for Season 1 is to attract 1 million users from 15 projects.
2. 3.5 million Users: The target for Season 2 is to gain 3.5 million users from 15 projects.

## Competition Structure

The Open League will have a seasonal structure to **gamify **the launch of mini-apps and create perfect moments for projects to launch new features and updates.

### Participation

Projects can apply to be part of the season and receive promotion from the TON Foundation and incentives for their users.

1. For Projects: Creating perfect moments to captivate and onboard active users from Telegram to TON.
2. For Users: Directing them to the best projects gamifying onboarding with incentives for TON mini-app usage.

![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")

Projects can make their proposal and put themselves in different leagues:

1. 500,000: Projects that believe they can attract 1 million users within a season can receive 500,000 XP as a reward.
2. 200,000: Projects that aim to attract 500,000 users within a season can receive 200,000 XP.
3. 20,000: Projects targeting 50,000 users within a season can receive 20,000 XP.

### Incentives

In TON Open League, incentives would go to users in 2 ways:

1. Soul-bound tokens (SBTs) - given for sustained on-chain activity
2. Via projects that are awarded incentives grants by community vote

Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")

The above is the SBTs that can be earned in the pilot season.

**Users** will earn experience points (XP), which are reputation points redeemable for TON at a time-based exchange rate. The Community Bot will act as the entry point for the incentives program, and users can complete quests to earn XP and collectibles. Referrals and boosts will also play a significant role in maximizing rewards.

Experience Points (XP) would become reputation points and be redeemable for $TON

1. XP, backed 1:1 with $TON, can be exchanged for $TON anytime.
2. A time-based formula affects the exchange rate – the sooner you redeem, the higher the discount.

### Ton Society

TON Society will serve as the user's profile, showcasing their XP, total earnings, and collectibles. It will also act as the incentives governance platform, where projects can submit proposals to be part of the season.
